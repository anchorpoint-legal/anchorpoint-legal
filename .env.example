# Web3Forms Configuration (Optional)
# 
# Note: Using environment variables is OPTIONAL for Web3Forms access keys.
# Web3Forms access keys are designed to be safe for client-side use and can
# be hardcoded directly in your HTML without security concerns.
#
# However, if you prefer to use environment variables for organizational
# purposes or to keep different keys for different environments, you can:
#
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the placeholder with your actual key
# 3. Configure vite.config.js to pass the variable to Nunjucks templates
# 4. Update src/pages/contact-body.njk to use the variable
#
# See WEB3FORMS_SETUP.md for detailed instructions.

# VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here

# Base path configuration for deployment
# VITE_BASE_PATH=/anchorpoint-legal/
