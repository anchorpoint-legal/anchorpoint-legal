                                <p>Use of this website, or contact with AnchorPointCompliance through electronic communication,
                                    does not create an attorney-client relationship. An advisory relationship is only
                                    established through a specific, written engagement agreement signed by both parties.
                                </p>

                                <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-5 mt-5">No Litigation Services</h4>
                                <p>AnchorPointCompliance does not provide litigation services. We do not represent clients in
                                    court, administrative hearings, or any adversarial proceedings. Our focus is
                                    exclusively on proactive regulatory health and internal capacity building.</p>

                                <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-5 mt-5">Professional Responsibility</h4>
                                <p>If your organization requires legal representation or advice regarding a specific
                                    legal dispute, you should consult with a law firm that provides litigation and legal
                                    advocacy services. AnchorPointCompliance can work alongside your existing legal counsel to
                                    support compliance implementation, but we cannot replace them in matters of legal
                                    representation.</p>
